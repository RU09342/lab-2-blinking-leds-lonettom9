# Off Board Blink
## Objective
The goal of this was to show the versatility of the MSP430G2553. Beacuse the G2 board 
stores the last code installed to it, the microprocessor can be removed to from the pcb 
and used in breadboard circuits. 
## Summary
In this specific instance, the G2 board was coded with the
Multiblink code. Once the microprocessor WAS placed on the breadboard, proper value resistors 
(1KOHM) WERE USED TO CONNECT THE LED's to the microprocessor. What resulted is the two LED's
blinking independently at different clock rates.
