#Button Blink
##Objective
This project involves using polling in order to turn on a blinking LED with the press of a button. 
##Summary
This lab involved initializing an LED as an output (P1.0) and then starting an infinite loop where the output of the LED is constantly toggled using the exclusive OR. 
###Board Changes
The only changes made to get the LED to blink for all five boards was changing the pin number.
